Filters a list of files, leaving only those which transitively dependent on any of the files from the second list

## Features

1. Supports js, jsx, ts, tsx.
1. Fast.
2. Resolves all symlinks to real filenames.
3. Skip node_modules.

## Example

Lets say we have four files: `a.js` depends on `b.js`, which depends on `c.js`, which depends on `.d.js`. Then:

```js
import { filterDependent } from 'filter-dependent'

const filteredFiles = filterDependent([
    './a.js',
    './b.js',
    './d.js',
], [
    'c.js'.
])

// â†’ ['/abs/path/to/a.js', '/abs/path/to/b.js']
```
